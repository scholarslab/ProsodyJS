# Prosody JS

A JavaScript library for
[prosody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)).
Originally part of [For Better For
Verse](http://prosody.lib.virginia.edu/), developed by Herbert Tucker
(Professor of English, University of Virginia) and the [Scholars'
Lab](http://scholarslab.org)

This project seeks to pull out the functionality of the Prosody project that is bundled into the WordPress theme and plugin into a standalone JavaScript library.

The project is not actively maintained or developed by Scholars' Lab, but anyone should feel free to fork the project and work on it. Pull requests are accepted.



### Dependencies

- npm: gulp, gulp-stylus, autoprefixer-stylus
